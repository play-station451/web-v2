## <span style="color: #32ae62;">Setup</span>

> <span style="font-family: url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap'); color: #ffd900;">⚠</span> <span style="color: #ffd900;">NOTE:</span> Terbium **WILL NOT** build on versions of Node older than version 20.

To get started it's pretty easy, you need either npm, or pnpm, which can be installed by running: `npm i -g pnpm` and then you just need to the run following command:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm start # Replace pnpm with npm if your not going to use pnpm
```

and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should be good to go!

If you are developing/modifying terbium you can just run `pnpm run dev`, **DO NOT** use the development server for Production use. Instead, just run `pnpm start`. For any further backend configuration visit the `.env` file to configure the backend a bit.

> If you are going to static host Terbium, you will need to change the wisp server, and you would need to follow those steps. Refer to this [document](./docs/static-hosting.md) for more information.
