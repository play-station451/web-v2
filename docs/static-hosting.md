For this tutorial, Cloudflare pages will be used however the instructions will be similar on other static hosts.

### <span style="color: #32ae62;">Step 1.</span>

Fork this repository and connect your github account to the static host of your choise.

### <span style="color: #32ae62;">Step 2.</span>

Under the `build` section command put: `npm i; npm run build` **LEAVE THE START COMMAND BLANK IF IT EXISTS**

Then under the output directory put the folder: `dist` and click Deploy

Now that the sites deployed, you have probably noticed that the Default wisp server wont be running since your static hosting. If you wish to change this navigate to `sys/init/index.ts` scroll down to Line 41 and replace the line: `${location.protocol.replace("http", "ws")}//${location.hostname}:${location.port}/wisp/` with the wisp server of your choice as a string. If you dont want to do this you dont have to as you can change it in the OOBE.
